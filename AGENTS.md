# Clocktower Agent Guide

## Working style

- Write progress updates in Korean using caveman lite style.

## Code-change completion checklist

When finishing a requested code change, run the relevant tests, perform a code review pass, commit the finished work, and push the branch unless the user asks otherwise or the operation is blocked.

This checklist applies to code changes only. Do not run tests, code review, commit, or push for ordinary questions, planning, research, or documentation-only updates unless the user explicitly requests it.

When using the `implement` skill, TDD is encouraged but not mandatory. Use TDD where it fits a clear, pre-agreed seam; otherwise implement with focused validation and explain why TDD was skipped.

- When closing a ticket, include regression coverage for the changed behavior when practical. Prefer the smallest test that would fail before the fix. If no regression test is added, state why in the completion note.
- For Rust changes, run `cargo test --workspace`.
- For web changes, run `pnpm --dir web test` and `pnpm --dir web build` when relevant.
- For local dev-server validation, bind to `0.0.0.0`.
- If commit or push is blocked by unrelated worktree changes, permissions, or network access, report the blocker clearly.
